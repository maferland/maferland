  "body": "## What I know\n\nThis will be short. I basically know nothing. Not exactly nothing as I do have some basic. But I don't know enough. Not enough for building an accessible website. And by that, I mean a truly accessible website. Have you ever used a screen reader? I know I never did. At least not on purpose. Keyboard smashing? Anyone?\n\n- Do I test what I develop with a screen reader? Nope ❌\n\n- Do I make sure what I develop is accessible? Never ❌\n\n- Will I work to improve that aspect of my work? Yep ✅\n\n- Should this be as important as responsiveness? Sure ✅\n\n## Better mindset\n\nI recently built a little website. It's nothing really, but it's a place where I learn to use TailwindCSS. It's built with Next.js and is hosted on Netlify. While I worked on that project, I started to build a bunch of basics components; titles, nav, buttons, etc.\n\nI started working on a little \\`tooltip\\` component. While working on it my mind drifted a bit :\n\n> How should I write this component for it to make sense for search engines?\n\nThat's a normal reflex, isn't it? Performance, responsiveness and SEO are classic concerns for a frontend engineer. Then, something else came to my mind. How would I make it work with a screen reader? And that's it. Pandora's box was opened. A whole new part of my job was brought to my attention.\n\n## Room for improvements\n\nSo, how should I build this component? The answer is not simple. Not at all. In fact, at this very moment, I still don't know how to make it. I toyed with some ideas and found one of the many resources that will help me in my learning process ([here 👈](https://inclusive-components.design/tooltips-toggletips/)).\n\n\n\nHere is my plan:\n\n1. I have to learn about how people with a wide range of disabilities use the web. This includes learning how to use a screen reader\n2. Learn about accessibility and the best practices.\n3. Keep building new components and learning how to make them fully accessible.\n4. Write about it. Learning in public is something I want to more often. I'll write about my progress here."
