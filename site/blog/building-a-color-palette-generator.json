  "description": "Very few of the projects I begin end up being released. For once, I managed to build something useful. Here is how I built Paletteify.",
  "body": "## Why did I need it\n\nOne of the most important things, when I build something, is that I, Marc-Antoine Ferland, actually want to use it. If I don't need it I won't find the drive to complete it. I'll start the project, learn whatever I wanted from the tech stack I started and that's it. The project will soon be forgotten. Plus, it's very hard to build something actually solving a problem if you don't experience the problem for yourself."
