  "description": "Very few of the projects I begin end up being released. For once, I managed to build something useful. Here is how I built Paletteify.",
  "body": "## Why is it useful?\n\nOne of the most important things, when I build something, is that I, Marc-Antoine Ferland, actually want to use it. If I don't need it I won't find the drive to complete it. I'll start the project, learn whatever I wanted from the tech stack I started and that's it. The project will soon be forgotten. Plus, it's very hard to build something actually solving a problem if you don't experience the problem for yourself.\n\nBut not this time. So what was different you might ask? Well, I had a real use case. I wanted to generate a colour palette for a website. I could have simply screenshotted the whole page and generated the palette from the image but that wouldn't have been as much fun isn't it? I was also too lazy to pick the pipette and select the colours all by one.\n\n> 💡 Initial idea was to generate a Slack theme. I was invited to my new company's Slack (more info on that soon 😍) and I wanted to customize my Slack.\n\nGenerating a viable Slack colour theme was a little too complex. I decided to _simply_ generate the colour palette and not worry too much if it would be usable on Slack (it almost never is 😱). I say simply because as you will see, it ended up being a fair bit more complex than I expected. The infrastructure I ended up with is far different from what I had in mind. That's a great thing because I learned a couple of new tricks that could be very handy in the future.\n\nAnother important aspect is that I think expectations must be scoped down. Keep it simple and iterate. I had the desire to ship a v1 quickly. This gives me a chance to collect feedback but also to feel some sense of accomplishment. Now that it's online I can iterate on it when I feel like it without any pressure. If the website ends up being used, well I can scale my infra and add more features. But at least it's **live** now 🎉. Even if I don't write another line of code for that project it's not rotting in a git repository. It provides real value (at least a little 😜)."
