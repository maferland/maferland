  "description": "CSS doesn't support transition for background gradient. It will instead change the whole gradient suddenly. But what if you could? I wanna show you how I worked around the limitation of CSS with this nice little trick.",
  "body": "## The problem\n\nHave you ever been asked by a designer if you could make a transition from one background gradient to another? Something like that should work, right?\n\n```css\n.gradient {\n  background: linear-gradient(red, blue);\n  transition: background 0.2s ease-in\n}\n\n.invert {\n  background: linear-gradient(blue, red);\n}\n```\n\nWell, I did try it when this was part of a design I had to implement this week. Sadly, it doesn't work. The page will instead change suddenly from one gradient to another ðŸ˜ž. And it's pretty understandable. It would be a quite complex feature to take all the pixels of the gradient and compute the transition to another color.\n\n ## The workaround\n\nThis might not work for every issue but for simple gradients, you can clearly use this little hack to get pretty neat visual effects.\n\nThe idea is to use a transparent gradient as an overlay and use the simple background-color transition. To obtain a very similar effect.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"container\" id=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"gradient\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\n```css\n.container {\n  background: red;\n  transition: background 1s ease-in;\n  width: 400px;\n  height: 400px;\n}\n\n.gradient {\n  background: linear-gradient(white, transparent);\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nSo, now we have this color gradient from red to white. And if we change the `.container` color we'll have the 1s ease in transition.\n\n ## Show me the code\n\nOkay, here's a better example!\n\n<br />\n\n<p class=\"codepen\" data-height=\"265\" data-theme-id=\"dark\" data-default-tab=\"js,result\" data-user=\"maferland\" data-slug-hash=\"QWEZKYR\" style=\"height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;\" data-pen-title=\"QWEZKYR\">\n\n  <span>See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/maferland/pen/QWEZKYR\">\n\nColor Gradient</a> by Marc-Antoine Ferland (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/maferland\">@maferland</a>)</span>\n\n</p>\n\n<script async src=\"https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>"
